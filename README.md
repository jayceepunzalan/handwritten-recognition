# Multiple Handwritten Digit Recognition

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

In this project, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed to predict the images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. 

Also, a tool with GUI was created using the PyQt5 library. This tool that can classify a user's handwritten digit input using the CNN model.
